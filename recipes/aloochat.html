    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse 3 medium sized potatoes (250 grams) in fresh water and then peel them. Chop the potatoes in small bite sized cubes.</li>
        <li> Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan or kadai on a medium heat. Add the potato cubes for frying. Use any neutral flavored with a high smoke point for frying.</li>
        <li>Mix with the oil and begin to fry them. Remember to fry at medium heat.</li>
        <li>When one side becomes golden, turn the potatoes over and fry them on the other side. Keep on turning the potatoes at intervals using a slotted spoon until they are fried evenly.</li>
        <li>Fry until the potatoes are crispy and golden. Make sure the potato cubes are not raw or half-cooked on the inside.</li>
        <li>Fry until the potatoes are crispy and golden. Make sure the potato cubes are not raw or half-cooked on the inside.</li>
        <li> Place fried potato cubes on kitchen paper towels to absorb extra oil. Then, fry the second batch of potatoes if you have used a small or medium-sized wok or pan.</li>
        <li> When the potatoes are still hot take all of them in a mixing bowl</li>
        <li> Then add the ground spice powders.</li>
        <li>Next, add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped mint leaves and 2 tablespoons of finely chopped coriander leaves (cilantro).</li>
        <li>Toss and mix well.</li>
        <li> Then add 1 tablespoon of sweet tamarind chutney. Add less or more to suit your taste. At this step you can add coriander chutney or green chutney if you want.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons of lemon juice for some tang.</li>
        <li>Toss and mix everything very well. The chutney, spice powders and lemon juice should coat the fried potatoes evenly. Taste the potatoes and adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
        <li> Add chaat to a serving bowl and serve aloo chaat garnish with pomegranate arils or sev (fried gram flour vermicelli) and serve as an evening snack or starter.</li>
